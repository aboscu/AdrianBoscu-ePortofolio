										<p>The case study I chose to look into is Malware Disruption found at the following link: [Case: Malware Disruption - ACM Ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-malware-disruption/)

										<p>The Rogue Services provide we hosting services with guaranteed uptime no matter what and as some of their customers are independent web based retailers the majority of them are focused on malware and spam as well as several botnets protecting their malicious activities as well as their command-and-control servers.</p>
										<p>The case study is focused on the Rogue the violation of several principles of the Code of Ethics by allowing hosting of malicious software as well as different vulnerability tools as well as facilitating harm to other caused by their clients and failing to fight against malicious hosting and code. At the same time we can also focus on the malware developed to bring down the Rouge’s clients and network developed specifically for it.</p>
										<p>We can look at Roug’s failure to address the code of conduct or ethics according to  Bcs.org. (2022) which dictates that an organisation or individual have to carry out professional responsibility and due care and diligence in accordance with relevant authority while exercising professional judgement.</p>
										<p>At the same time if we look at the malware developed for bringing down the Roug’s network specifically while at the same time affecting no other ISP or customer conflicts the first point of BCS Code of Conduct which states that we should have regards of public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and their environment (Bcs.org. 2022) while non-malicious customer of Roug’s network were also affected and perhaps brought down legitimate business.</p>
